# Bayesian modelling with brms package 
## From research question to final report, unleashing the full potential of brms

This repository contains all the data, code and figures used to create the tutorial available [here](https://eddatascienceees.github.io/tutorial-louise-litrico/)

Repo structure: 
- Data available [here](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-louise-litrico/tree/master/Data), from the Living Planet Index (full details [here](http://www.livingplanetindex.org/home/index))
- Initial code used to create the tutorial available [here](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-louise-litrico/tree/master/Code)
- Figures created and used in the tutorial are available [here](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-louise-litrico/tree/master/Figures)
- All pictures used in the tutorial are under Public Domain (credit: U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service - Northeast Region) available [here](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-louise-litrico/tree/master/Pictures)
- The [extra](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-louise-litrico/tree/master/Extra) folder contains instructions for this tutorial along with the licence used for this repo

Tutorial information: 

This tutorial is aimed at people with a prior understanding of beginner-level modelling, R coding and RStudio. It builds on two tutorials created by the [Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io).
Those tutorials are:
- Meta-analysis for biologists using MCMCglmm (an introcution to the MCMCglmm package) available [here](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/mcmcglmm/index.html)
- Generalised linear models in Stan (using the Rstanarm and brms packages to run Stan models) available [here](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/stan-2/)

This tutorial should teach you how to create, assess, present and troubleshoot a brm model. 

Please open the tutorial in Safari if possible to be sure to view all the Figures properly (some output figures don't show up in Chrome for some reason).
